               <p>
                <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: Brain Computer Interface technology enables a pathway for analyzing EEG signals for
seizure detection. EEG signal decomposition, features extraction and machine learning techniques are
more familiar in seizure detection. However, selecting decomposition technique and concatenation of
their features for seizure detection is still in the state-of-the-art phase. This work proposes DWT-EMD
Feature level Fusion-based seizure detection approach over multi and single channel EEG signals
and studied the usability of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and empirical mode decomposition
(EMD) feature fusion with respect to individual DWT and EMD features over classifiers SVM, SVM
with RBF kernel, decision tree and bagging classifier for seizure detection. All classifiers achieved an
improved performance over DWT-EMD feature level fusion for two benchmark seizure detection
EEG datasets. Detailed quantification results have been mentioned in the Results section.

               <p>
			   <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: Scalp EEG plots are plots of scalp potentials against time, and hence, capture spatial information, owing to the placement of electrodes on the scalp, as well as, temporal information from variations in brain waves. In this
paper we propose a novel method to make a combined representation of spatial and temporal information, by incorporating the signals into a sparse spatio-temporal frame, such that it can be easily processed by deep
learning algorithms in the computer vision domain. Familiarities of a model to the test data in the setting of emotion recognition from EEG, is also defined, and a form of data splitting such that the model has to perform on
a set with which it has the minimum degree of familiarity is introduced. A CapsNet architecture is trained on DEAP dataset to perform on a cross-subject binary classification task, and tuning of the hyperparameters using
Bayesian Optimization is analyzed. The proposed model reports a best-case accuracy of 0.85396 and average case accuracy of 0.57165 for LOO subject, and a best case of 1.0 and average case of 0.51071 for unseen-subjectunseen-record classification, when averaged across all the classes (i.e., valence, dominance, arousal, and
liking), which is comparable to that reported by other works.

               <p>
                <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: Seizures are the part of the epilepsy that occurs in central nervous system which leads abnormal brain
activity. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recordings are mostly used in epileptic seizure detection
process. Detection of seizures is a crucial part for further treatment of patients. This paper proposes a
multi-view SVM model for seizure detection using the single channel EEG signals. In this experiment,
two views of the EEG data have been extracted, (1) the time domain features using Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) and (2) power spectral densities are obtained in the frequency domain.
Extracted features have been fed to multi-view SVM classification model. In this study, a single channel EEG dataset is used for seizure detection. Performance estimation parameters namely Accuracy,
Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-score, and AUC value have been estimated for evaluating the proposed
model. The model classified seizure and non-seizure over the sets A vs E and B vs E with an accuracy
greater than 99% using k-fold cross validation. The classification accuracy obtained by multi-view
SVM is better by 1–4% than single view SVM using the same features. Furthermore, the proposed
model is also compared with existing single view SVM models. It is observed that the multi view SVM
model performed significantly better, compare to a single view SVM model over the same features.

               <p>
			   <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: This work proposes a scheme for Seizure Detection from the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal data generated due to the
electrochemical process in the human nervous system and acquired from the human brain scalp using electrode placement. In this experiment, the complete workflow divided into three parts to get a better performance of our proposed methodology. These
Parts are raw EEG Signal data filtering, Spectrogram feature matrix generation and finally, One-Dimensional Convolution Network has been used for Seizure Detection. Thus, our main objective in this work is to represent a methodology with the
combination of two methods Spectrogram and 1D CNN which can be one possible approach for seizure detection. Our proposed methodology achieved comparable performance in terms of Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy.

               <p>
                <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: Seizure is an unexpected, uncontrollable disturbance in the neuronal activity of the brain 
				in which human being encounters changes in functioning, motion, emotions, and in levels of consciousness. The paper 
				proposes a methodology for the detection of seizures using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals through Channel Selection. 
				Seizure detection using all the EEG channels leads less detection accuracy as well as high computation. 
				The trade-off between accuracy and computation is done by using channel optimization techniques. 
				The proposed methodology consists of a channel optimization technique which integrates Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) 
				with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to give the optimized set of channels. The data of the optimized set of channels is then 
				classified using Extreme Learning Machine for gauging its performance. 
				The result obtained from the proposed methodology is compared with the results without channel optimization technique. 
				Also, the result is compared with the combination of channels obtained through maximized and minimized Fitness function. 
				The proposed methodology achieved a maximum detection accuracy of 93.21% with only 6/23 channels, whereas ELM achieved a 
				maximum detection accuracy of 90.27% without channel Selection. Thus, it effectively solves the problem associated with using all 
				the channels and achieves better detection accuracy.
