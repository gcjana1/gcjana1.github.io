               <p>
			   <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: The objective of this study is to propose an approach to detect Seizure and Non-Seizure
phenomenon from the highly inconsistent and non-linear EEG signals. In the view of performing cross-subject classification over the inconsistency and non-linear characteristics of EEG signals, we have proposed a fine-tuned Capsule Neural Network (CapsNet)
based approach to classify the seizure and non-seizure EEG signals through subject specific and cross-subject training and testing. In this experiment, first we have normalized the input data using L2 normalization technique. In the second step, the normalized
data have been given to the CapsNet and model level fine-tuning has been carried out. In addition to this, we have performed seizure and non-seizure classification performance
evaluation using three more classifiers such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network to compare with the performance of the proposed approach. To estimate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, subject specific and
cross-subject training and testing have been performed. In both experiments, we have used multi-channel and single channel EEG datasets. For subject specific experiment, the
proposed approach achieved a mean accuracy of 93.50% over the dataset-1 (multichannel) and an accuracy of 82.61% for dataset-2 (single channel). For cross-subject experiment, the proposed approach achieved a highest mean accuracy of 86.41% over the
dataset-1(multi-channel) and a mean accuracy of 48.45% over the dataset-2 (single channel) which shows an advantage of CapsNet in a certain data scenario as described
in result section. Overall performance of the proposed approach shown a comparable improvement over the existing approaches.

               <p>
                <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: Brain Computer Interface technology enables a pathway for analyzing EEG signals for
seizure detection. EEG signal decomposition, features extraction and machine learning techniques are
more familiar in seizure detection. However, selecting decomposition technique and concatenation of
their features for seizure detection is still in the state-of-the-art phase. This work proposes DWT-EMD
Feature level Fusion-based seizure detection approach over multi and single channel EEG signals
and studied the usability of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and empirical mode decomposition
(EMD) feature fusion with respect to individual DWT and EMD features over classifiers SVM, SVM
with RBF kernel, decision tree and bagging classifier for seizure detection. All classifiers achieved an
improved performance over DWT-EMD feature level fusion for two benchmark seizure detection
EEG datasets. Detailed quantification results have been mentioned in the Results section.

               <p>
			   <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: Scalp EEG plots are plots of scalp potentials against time, and hence, capture spatial information, owing to the placement of electrodes on the scalp, as well as, temporal information from variations in brain waves. In this
paper we propose a novel method to make a combined representation of spatial and temporal information, by incorporating the signals into a sparse spatio-temporal frame, such that it can be easily processed by deep
learning algorithms in the computer vision domain. Familiarities of a model to the test data in the setting of emotion recognition from EEG, is also defined, and a form of data splitting such that the model has to perform on
a set with which it has the minimum degree of familiarity is introduced. A CapsNet architecture is trained on DEAP dataset to perform on a cross-subject binary classification task, and tuning of the hyperparameters using
Bayesian Optimization is analyzed. The proposed model reports a best-case accuracy of 0.85396 and average case accuracy of 0.57165 for LOO subject, and a best case of 1.0 and average case of 0.51071 for unseen-subjectunseen-record classification, when averaged across all the classes (i.e., valence, dominance, arousal, and
liking), which is comparable to that reported by other works.

               <p>
                <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: Seizures are the part of the epilepsy that occurs in central nervous system which leads abnormal brain
activity. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recordings are mostly used in epileptic seizure detection
process. Detection of seizures is a crucial part for further treatment of patients. This paper proposes a
multi-view SVM model for seizure detection using the single channel EEG signals. In this experiment,
two views of the EEG data have been extracted, (1) the time domain features using Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) and (2) power spectral densities are obtained in the frequency domain.
Extracted features have been fed to multi-view SVM classification model. In this study, a single channel EEG dataset is used for seizure detection. Performance estimation parameters namely Accuracy,
Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-score, and AUC value have been estimated for evaluating the proposed
model. The model classified seizure and non-seizure over the sets A vs E and B vs E with an accuracy
greater than 99% using k-fold cross validation. The classification accuracy obtained by multi-view
SVM is better by 1–4% than single view SVM using the same features. Furthermore, the proposed
model is also compared with existing single view SVM models. It is observed that the multi view SVM
model performed significantly better, compare to a single view SVM model over the same features.

               <p>
                <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: Seizure is an unexpected, uncontrollable disturbance in the neuronal activity of the brain 
				in which human being encounters changes in functioning, motion, emotions, and in levels of consciousness. The paper 
				proposes a methodology for the detection of seizures using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals through Channel Selection. 
				Seizure detection using all the EEG channels leads less detection accuracy as well as high computation. 
				The trade-off between accuracy and computation is done by using channel optimization techniques. 
				The proposed methodology consists of a channel optimization technique which integrates Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) 
				with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to give the optimized set of channels. The data of the optimized set of channels is then 
				classified using Extreme Learning Machine for gauging its performance. 
				The result obtained from the proposed methodology is compared with the results without channel optimization technique. 
				Also, the result is compared with the combination of channels obtained through maximized and minimized Fitness function. 
				The proposed methodology achieved a maximum detection accuracy of 93.21% with only 6/23 channels, whereas ELM achieved a 
				maximum detection accuracy of 90.27% without channel Selection. Thus, it effectively solves the problem associated with using all 
				the channels and achieves better detection accuracy.

               <p>
			   <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: A wide variety of machine learning techniques
have been developed which could aid in the analysis of
continuous EEG time-series data and derive useful insights from
it. The techniques which have been most popularly used for such
analysis include Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines,
and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Extreme Learning Machines
are one of the newest additions to these classifiers. The present
work compares the performance of these classifiers on both
single channel and multi-channel EEG recordings. Two
different datasets used for the experiments are (a) EEG
database by University of Bonn, Germany for single channel
recordings, (b) CHB-MIT dataset for multi-channel recordings.
In all these experiments, we assume that the recordings, after
preprocessing, are all free from such defects which could affect
the performance of different classifiers differently. For
preprocessing, filtered recordings are segmented and DWT is
applied on them to use the transform coefficients for feature
extraction. These extracted features were then fed into various
classifiers. It was observed that ELM classifiers could perform
at par or better than the conventional classification methods.

Signals Classification</h5>
               <p>
                <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: In this paper, a comparative analysis has been done to estimate a robust
classifier to classify motor imagery EEG data. First, segment detection and feature
extraction have been done over the rawEEGdata. Then the frequency domain features
have been extracted using FFT. Six classifiers DNN, SVM, KNN, Naïve Bayes,’
Random Forest, and Decision Tree have been considered for this study. The DNN
model configured with four layers and used the binary cross-entropy loss function
and sigmoid activation function for all layers. The optimizer used is “Adam” having
the default-learning rate of 0.001. In this experiment, for the purpose of the estimation
of the performance of various classifiers, the experiment used dataset IVa from BCI
Competition III, which consisted of EEG signal data for five subjects, namely ‘aa,’
‘al,’ ‘av,’ ‘aw,’ and ‘ay.’ The highest average accuracy of 70.32% achieved by the
DNN model, whereas the model achieved an accuracy of 80.39% over the subject
‘aw.’ The objective of this experiment encompasses the different models for the
classification of various motor tasks from EEG signals.

of Epileptic Electroencephalogram Signals</h5>
               <p>
			   <b><i>Abstract</i></b>: This paper demonstrates an approach based on Deep Transfer Learning for the classification for Seizure and Nonseizure Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Recognizing seizure signals in intelligent way is quite important in clinical
diagnosis of Epileptic seizure. Various traditional and deep machine learning techniques are employed for this purpose.
However, the Epileptic seizure prediction and classification performance is not satisfactory over small EEG dataset using
traditional approaches. The Transfer learning approach overcomes this by reusing the pre-trained networks such as googlenet,
resnet101 and vgg19 trained on large Image database. This experiment has been done in two phases: (1) RGB image dataset
generated for the seizure and non-seizure EEG signals data of University of Bonn using a novel preprocessing technique, (2) we
configured googlenet, resnet101 and vgg19 trained networks to learn a new pattern or features from the RGB image Dataset and
finally, above mentioned networks have been used for the classification. The use of Vgg19 network shows greater accuracy
among the three but takes comparatively more prediction time. We will mainly emphasize on the results obtained from the
googlenet, since it provides effective accuracy taking less time for prediction. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
above 99% for a smaller number of epochs and maximum accuracy of 100% when we increase number of epochs. Experimental
outcomes show the proposed approach using googlent achieved better performance w.r.t to many state-of-the-art classification
algorithms even on the small EEG dataset. In addition, classification performance of our proposed approach has compared with
different traditional machine learning techniques over the same input data.
